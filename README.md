# Anomalt Data Analysis Based on UNSW-NB15-1.0.csv
he new dataset acquired the
maximum data information. The test score rate can achieve
99.86% and 95%, respectively. The authors provide an overall
method from raw data preprocessing to a model building and
metric assessment for further analysis in the anomaly detection
domain. Besides, all coding and experiment data related to this
research are open to other researchers
